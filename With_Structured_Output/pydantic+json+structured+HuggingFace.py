I recently purchased the XPhone Pro Max, and while the hardware is outstanding,
the software leaves much to be desired. The build quality feels premium, the 
display is bright and vivid, and the battery easily lasts a full day even with 
heavy use. However, the pre-installed apps take up unnecessary space, and many 
cannot be uninstalled, which is frustrating. The user interface feels outdated 
compared to competitors like OnePlus and Samsung, with clunky animations and 
inconsistent icon designs. On the bright side, the camera delivers excellent 
photos in daylight and decent low-light performance. I really hope the company 
pushes a major software update to modernize the experience.
